## Charter

The group is chartered until October 2025.

To learn about the current focus, scope and deliverables, see the [AGWG Charter](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/charter).

## Current Work

For details of the current work, see the [AGWG wiki](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Main_Page).

### WCAG 3

Work on W3C Accessibility Guidelines 3 takes place in many task forces and subgroups of the Working Group. Information about projects and timelines is available on the [WCAG 3 Project Plan](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/WCAG_3_Timeline).

### WCAG 2.2

The [WCAG 2.x Backlog Task Force](/about/groups/task-forces/wcag2x-backlog) maintains WCAG 2.x for AGWG. This includes reviewing public comments andimproving the supporting Understanding and Techniques documents.

Current outstanding issues are shown in [WCAG issues](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/).

## Contribute to the work

W3C and the AG Working Group actively encourage contributions from the whole accessibility community. You can contribute without being a member of the working group in a number of ways:

* **Comment on publications** &mdash; During development, the group publishes working drafts for public comment. These are announced on the [WAI News pages](/news/) and on the [WAI-IF Mailing List](/about/groups/waiig/).
* **Raise, comment on, or propose fixes to [WCAG 2.x issues](https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/)** &mdash; If you are aware of an issue with any of the published WCAG 2.x resources then raise an issue. We also are extremely welcoming of comments on existing issues or, even better, proposed solutions.
* **Contribute to WCAG 3 discussions** &mdash; There are many topics to be discussed and better understood as WCAG 3 develops. See the list of current [WCAG 3 discussions](https://github.com/w3c/wcag3/discussions) to contribute.
* **Participate in a Community Group** &mdash; There are a small number of active Community Groups focusing on accessibility issues. See [Community Groups](https://www.w3.org/community/groups) and search for 'accessibility' for more information.

### Become a participant
